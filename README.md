Cool Shades repo for 2nd session of class

Project 1 : Cool Shades
Peppers, a Pittsburgh Sunglasses company, is releasing a new pair of sunglasses that is so different than their other shades, including it's price point, that it does not make sense to display it on the website with all their other sunglasses.

Our Project
We'll be building a microsite for the Rock-N-Stroll sunglasses, featuring photography of the product and outlining the key features of the shades.

About the product
The new product, Rock-N-Stroll, are a pair of Bluetooth Bone Conduction Sunglasses that use cutting-edge technology to play music without the need for headphones. See Design Assets section below to see what we're building and download the images needed for the project.
